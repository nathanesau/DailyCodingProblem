# DailyCodingProblem

Python solutions to some of the [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) questions.

The solutions and problem descriptions are in ``src`` folder.

## Workflow

1. Open Repository with [gitpod](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod), i.e. [gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nathanesau/DailyCodingProblem](gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nathanesau/DailyCodingProblem)

2. Write code in web browser. GitPod has a built in debugging capability.
